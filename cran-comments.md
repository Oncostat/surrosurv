On R-hub, there are 2 false-positive NOTES:

## Comments

I am Dan Chaltiel, the new maintainer of {surrosurv} as Federico Rotolo left our institution (Gustave Roussy institute, France).
His institutional adress <federico.rotolo@gustaveroussy.fr> does not exist anymore, unfortunately.
I think you had the same problem with another of his packages recently, {parfm} if I'm correct.

This release is the correction to maintain surrosurv on the CRAN.
